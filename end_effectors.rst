.. Concepts
.. ========

.. Below are just some of the options you have available to you when selecting an
.. end effector for your robot application.

.. Sensing
.. -------

.. When it is necessary to perform reliable, repeatable, and automated data
.. acquisition.

.. Scanning
.. ~~~~~~~~

.. Build a 3 dimensional reconstruction of an object using a 2D front-facing lidar
.. or a depth camera.

.. Machine Vision
.. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. Inspect workpieces for wear and tear and perform non-destructive evaluation.

.. Grippers
.. --------

.. When it is necessary to move, sort, and place components.

.. Finger Grippers
.. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. Use parallel, adaptive, or other kinds of finger-like grippers to move parts
.. around the robot's workspace.

.. Suction
.. ~~~~~~~

.. Another method of moving smoother and more regular components without putting
.. much force on them.

.. Soft Grippers
.. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. These flexible grippers deform around an object to better handle irregular
.. parts.

.. Operation
.. ---------

.. Use your end effector to perform operations on parts or assemblies.

.. Tooled End Effectors
.. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. A classic example of a tooled end effector is using torque wrenches to
.. accurately install screws on an assembly.

.. Paint Sprayers/Sand Blasters
.. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. Automated application and removal of solvents and paints.
