This section provides instructions on setting up DobotSCStudio on your remote terminal.

.. note::

    DobotSCStudio is only supported on Windows.

1.  Make an account on `dobot.cn`_ and download the latest DobotSCStudio installer from the
    `Download Center > Control Software`_ section.

2.  Run the installer and accept all default options.

3.  Allow the Samba process to run.

4.  Reboot your computer.

5.  Make sure that your robot is turned on and that your remote terminal is connected to the
    cobot's network. After launching the DobotSCStudio, set your IP settings to track the right
    address. See the :doc:`Networking <../getting_started/networking>` section for details.

6.  The DobotSCStudio application will load all plugins and controllers. You are now able to
    control your cobot!
