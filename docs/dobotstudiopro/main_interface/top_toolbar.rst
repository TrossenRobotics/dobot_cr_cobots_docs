Alarm Log
=========

Alarms can be raised for various reasons including collisions, invalid IK solutions, singularities,
and over-temperature. If an alarm is raised when the robot is running, it will stop execution of
whatever program is running and the Alarm Log icon will update to show the number of alarms.
