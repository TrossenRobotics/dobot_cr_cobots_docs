Home Calibration
================

After some parts (motors, reduction gear units) of the robot arm have been replaced or the robot
has been hit, the home point of the robot will be changed. In this case you need to reset the home
point.

.. note::

    *   Home calibration is used only when the home position changes. Please operate cautiously.
    *   The home calibration function can be used after you enter the password (default password:
        ``888888``)

Move the robot to the home point according to the prompt in the page. Click **Home Calibration**
when the robot is enabled.

After calibration, you can check the joint coordinates in the control panel. Note that all joint
coordinates (J1-J6) are at zero degrees.
